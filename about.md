# About Me

Hi, I'm Rohitha. I'm a self-taught developer, and am curious about how computers work.
This website is my attempt at documenting my learnings in the field.

I'm always happy to chat about IaC and any related topics around it, so feel free to reach out :) I'm reachable by email (yrohitha996@gmail.com)!
